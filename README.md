## Introduction

Welcome to the GenshinYuGiOh project! This is a custom expansion for Yu-Gi-Oh! simulators created by ModelZ, featuring cards inspired by the popular game Genshin Impact. This project brings the world of Teyvat to the dueling table, allowing you to play with your favorite Genshin characters and themes.

This expansion is designed for use with Yu-Gi-Oh! simulators that support custom cards, such as EDOPro or YGOPro.

## Features

*   **Genshin Archetype:** A new archetype of cards based on the characters and lore of Genshin Impact.
*   **Fusion-focused Gameplay:** The main mechanic of this expansion revolves around Fusion Summoning powerful monsters representing the Archons and other notable characters.
*   **Custom Counters:** Unique counter mechanics like "Lullaby Counter" and "Akara Counter" that introduce new strategies and playstyles.
*   **Custom Artwork:** High-quality card artwork to bring the Genshin Impact characters to life in the game.
*   **Multiple Archetypes:** The "Genshin" archetype is further divided into sub-archetypes representing the different nations of Teyvat:
    *   Mondstadt
    *   Liyue
    *   Inazuma
    *   Sumeru
    *   Fontaine

## Installation

To use these custom cards in your Yu-Gi-Oh! simulator, follow these steps:

1.  **Card Database (`.cdb` file):**
    *   Place the `genshin.cdb` file into the `expansions` folder of your simulator's directory.

2.  **Card Scripts (`.lua` files):**
    *   Place all the `.lua` files from the `script` folder into the `script` folder of your simulator's directory. If you already have a `script` folder in your `expansions` folder, you can merge the contents.

3.  **Card Pictures (`.jpg` files):**
    *   Place all the `.jpg` files from the `pics` folder into the `pics` folder of your simulator's directory.

4.  **Card Names and Descriptions (`strings.conf`):**
    *   Open the `strings.conf` file in the root of your simulator's directory.
    *   Copy the contents of the `strings.conf` file from this project and paste them at the end of your simulator's `strings.conf` file.

After completing these steps, you should be able to find and use the Genshin Impact custom cards in the deck editor of your simulator.
